Quantum model for calculating recapture probability of single atoms. 

The main script is `model_recapture_probability.py` and assisting functions etc. are located in `modules.py`

The script works as follows: first as the atom is trapped in an optical tweezer, it initilizes the wavefunction in a thermal distribution of harmonic oscillator states.
Subsequently the trap is switched off and
